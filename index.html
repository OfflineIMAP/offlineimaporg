<header><h1><a id="ref-description"></a>Welcome to the OfflineIMAP project</h1></header>
<p>OfflineIMAP is a tool to simplify your e-mail reading. You can read
the same mailbox from multiple computers. You get a current copy of your
messages on each computer, and changes you make one place will be
visible on all other systems. For instance, you can delete a message on
your home computer, and it will appear deleted on your work computer as
well. OfflineIMAP is also useful if you want to use a mail reader that
does not have IMAP support, has poor IMAP support, or does not provide
disconnected operation.</p>

<p>It is a Free Software project licensed under
the <a href="https://github.com/nicolas33/offlineimap/raw/master/COPYING">GNU
General Public License (v2+)</a>. You can download it for free, and you
can modify it. In fact, you are encouraged to contribute changes back to us.</p>

<p>OfflineIMAP is FAST; it features a multi-threaded synchronization
algorithm that can dramatically speed up performance in many situations
by synchronizing several different things simultaneously. The defaults
are very conservative, so you might want to check the configuration page
to learn how to enable multithreaded syncing.</p>

<p>OfflineIMAP is FLEXIBLE; you can customize which folders are synced via regular
expressions, lists, or Python expressions; a versatile and comprehensive
configuration file is used to control behavior; two user interfaces are
built-in; fine-tuning of synchronization performance is possible; internal or
external automation is supported; SSL and PREAUTH tunnels are both supported;
offline (or &quot;unplugged&quot;) reading is supported; and esoteric IMAP features are
supported to ensure compatibility with the widest variety of IMAP servers.</p>

<p>OfflineIMAP is SAFE; it absolutely attempts to never ever lose one of
your mails under any circumstances. Of course, legally speaking,
OfflineIMAP comes with no warranty, so I am not responsible if this
turns out to be wrong.</p>

<p>OfflineIMAP was originally written
by <a href="http://www.complete.org/JohnGoerzen">John Goerzen</a>, who
retired from maintaining it at then end of 2010.  It is now maintained
by Nicolas Sebrecht.  We are grateful for the great job John did and for having shared his project with us.</p>

<header><h1><a id="method-of-operation">Method of Operation</a></h1></header>

<p>OfflineIMAP traditionally operates by maintaining a hierarchy of mail
folders in Maildir format locally.  Your own mail reader will read mail
from this tree, and need never know that the mail comes from IMAP.
OfflineIMAP will detect changes to the mail folders on your IMAP server
and your own computer and bi-directionally synchronize them, copying,
marking, and deleting messages as necessary.</p>

<p>With OfflineIMAP 4.0, a powerful new ability has been introduced ―
the program can now synchronize two IMAP servers with each other, with
no need to have a Maildir layer in-between.  Many people use this if
they use a mail reader on their local machine that does not support
Maildirs.  People may install an IMAP server on their local machine, and
point both OfflineIMAP and their mail reader of choice at it.  This is
often preferable to the mail reader's own IMAP support since OfflineIMAP
supports many features (offline reading, for one) that most IMAP-aware
readers don't.  However, this feature is not as time-tested as
traditional syncing, so my advice is to stick with normal methods of
operation for the time being.</p>

<header><h1><a id="rf-sys-reqs" >System requirements</a></h1></header>

<p>OfflineIMAP works on pretty much any POSIX operating system, such as
Linux, BSD operating systems, MacOS X, Solaris. With some fiddling, it
reportedly ran under Windows as well (TODO: link to documentation
needed).</p>

<p>It requires: Python >= 2.6. (If you don't need SSL, it might still
work with python 2.4)</p>

<article>
<header><h1><a id="ref-quick-start"></a>Quick Start</h1></header>
<p>If you have already installed OfflineIMAP system-wide, or your system
administrator has done that for you, your task for setting up OfflineIMAP for
the first time is quite simple.  You just need to set up your configuration
file, make your folder directory, and run it!</p>
<p>You can quickly set up your configuration file.  The distribution
includes a file offlineimap.conf.minimal (Debian users may find this at
<tt>/usr/share/doc/offlineimap/examples/offlineimap.conf.minimal</tt>) that is a
basic example of setting of OfflineIMAP.  You can simply copy this file into
your home directory and name it <tt >.offlineimaprc</tt> (note the leading period).  A
command such as <tt>cp offlineimap.conf.minimal ~/.offlineimaprc</tt> will do it.
Or, if you prefer, you can just copy this text to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.offlineimaprc</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[general]
accounts = Test

[Account Test]
localrepository = Local
remoterepository = Remote

[Repository Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/Test

[Repository Remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = examplehost
remoteuser = jgoerzen
</pre>

<p>Now, edit the <tt class="docutils
literal"><span class="pre">~/.offlineimaprc</span></tt> file with your
favorite editor.  All you have to do is specify a directory for your
folders to be in (on the localfolders line), the host name of your IMAP
server (on the remotehost line), and your login name on the remote (on
the remoteuser line).  That's it!</p>
<p>To run OfflineIMAP, you just have to say offlineimap ― it will fire
up, ask you for a login password if necessary, synchronize your folders,
and exit.  That's it. See?</p>

<p>You could just throw away the rest of this finely-crafted,
perfectly-honed manual!  However, the default settings are not tuned for maximum performance so make sure you read the documentation to make sure you get the most out of OfflineIMAP.</p>
